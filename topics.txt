immutable
how to create such class
comparable comparator
executor
composition
threads
generics
collections
reflection
design patterns

1st :
count no of occurances of ch in a word - which DS to use and complexity
find second largest number in an array and complexity
why rest is stateless.can we not save cookies and sessions etc
design patterns u have used?
how can u implement hashmap 

Learning:
- Need to update resume and study about each. make cheatsheet for all
- hands on on java common questions
- complexity
- data structures
- left view of binary tree
-

LeaRNED:

1. Object and Classes : 
	- IS-A and HAS-A relationship
	- Inheritence vs Composition
	- Class having reference to another class is HAS-A/Composition
	- Class having reference to another object of same class - useful in Linked Lists
	- Its called Strategy Design Pattern - Duck problem

2. Memory and Storage
	- RAM
	- bits and bytes
	- memory is strip of bytes --> bits
	- Arrays - fixed length
	- int is 32 bits

3. LinkedLists
	-

4. Recursions - BigInteger
		- Frog Problem
		- Fibonacci
		- Factorial
5. Big-O and Time Complexity
